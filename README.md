# Theoretical and numerical aspects of Nuclear Physics project

#### In this repository you can find the source code, the resulting plot and the reference to the polonium problem, plus a brief presentation of the project. The matrix exponential method is implemented on Python 3.9.4 to solve the system of Bateman equations in order to find the variation over time of the nuclides concentration. In particular the production of Polonium-210 is studied as presented in the file 'Masterproef_Maren_Vranckx.pdf'
