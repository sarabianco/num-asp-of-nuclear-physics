# The Polonium Problem

## In this repository you can find the source code, the resulting plot and the reference to the polonium problem (p. 4-6).
### The code solve the system of Bateman equations referred to the Polonium problem. Once the different nuclide concentration for Bi-209, Bi-210 and Po-210 are computed over a period of time of one year, they are plotted and the results are presented in the folder 'plot'.
